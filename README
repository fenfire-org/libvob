Vobs - a novel 2 1/2D UI framework


LibVob contains implementations for the framework both in C++ OpenGL and in 
Java AWT. In addition, there's a JNI bridge for using the OpenGL 
implementation from Java. OpenGL requires a wrapper file under src/os per each 
operating platform (currently, the only one is for GLX on Linux).


Before compiling, you should have:
* Boost.org libraries version 1.30 
  (the Debian package is called libboost-dev)

* JAVAHOME pointing to the JDK, which should contain one of:
   * include/linux/jni.h
   * include/kaffe/jni.h
   * include/jni.h

* CVS module libvob-depends checked out as ../libvob-depends


Compile with command "make".


We try to optimize the C++ compilation to the hardware platform. In case of 
problems, please have a look at the options ARCH and OPTIMIZE in file rules.mk.


In the future, you should have the option of compiling only the AWT graphics 
code or only the C++ OpenGL graphics code, but at the moment the JNI bridge
is built anyway.
