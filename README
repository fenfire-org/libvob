Vobs - a novel 2 1/2D UI framework


LibVob contains implementations for the framework both in C++ OpenGL and in 
Java AWT. In addition, there's a JNI bridge for using the OpenGL 
implementation from Java. OpenGL requires a wrapper file under src/os per each 
operating platform (currently, the only one is for GLX on Linux).


Before compiling, you should have:
* Boost.org libraries version 1.30 
  (the Debian package is called libboost-dev)

* JAVAHOME pointing to the JDK, which should contain one of:
   * include/linux/jni.h
   * include/kaffe/jni.h
   * include/jni.h

* GL (e.g. package xlibmesa-gl-dev and possibly others)

* Glut (Package libglut3-dev)

* The GdkPixBuf library (Debian package libgdk-pixbuf-dev)

* Freetype (Debian package libfreetype6-dev)

* The http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/navidoc/ repository checked out
  as ../navidoc and compiled

* The http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/depends/ repository checked out 
  as ../depends

Alternatively, instead of getting the depends/ package, you can install 
the dependencies individually and set your classpath to include them.

There is no list of the actual dependencies here because someone would
certainly forget to add a new one, which would cause headaches to users.
Instead, search for CLASSPATH in the Makefile, and look for the list
of jars it imports from the depends directory; you can then head over
to http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/depends/ and figure out what these
jars are and how to install them. Ok, it's not easy, but if you want easy,
just get the depends/ repository and be done.

In addition to the jars, Libvob needs the stuff in the boost/ directory
in depends.


Compile with command "make". You can compile only the Java code
with "make java" (you won't need Boost then).


We try to optimize the C++ compilation to the hardware platform. In case of 
problems, please have a look at the options ARCH and OPTIMIZE in file rules.mk.


In the future, you should have the option of compiling
only the C++ OpenGL graphics code, but at the moment the JNI bridge
is built anyway.
